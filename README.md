Understanding Real-Time Chat
Before we dive into the technical implementation, it's crucial to grasp the concept of real-time chat and why it's a game-changer for modern web applications.

What is Real-Time Chat?

Real-time chat refers to a form of communication where messages are delivered instantly to recipients as they are sent, creating a conversation that flows seamlessly. Unlike traditional messaging systems, where users need to refresh or manually check for new messages, real-time chat provides an interactive and immediate exchange of information.

WebSockets: The Magic Behind Real-Time
Now that we understand the importance of real-time chat, it's time to uncover the magic that makes it all possible - WebSockets. WebSockets are the secret ingredient behind instantaneous, bidirectional communication in web applications.

The Basics of WebSocketsInitialization: A WebSocket connection begins with an initial handshake, much like when your web browser connects to a web server. This handshake is done using the HTTP protocol.
Upgrade to WebSocket: After the initial handshake, if both the client and server support WebSockets, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection. This upgrade is crucial because it allows the connection to stay open, enabling continuous, bidirectional communication.
Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded,
WebSockets facilitate full-duplex communication. In simpler terms, it means both the client and server can send messages to each other simultaneously, without the need for separate requests and responses.
